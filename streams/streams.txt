Nodejs.Streams

Streams are objects that you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion. In Nodejs there are four type of Streams:

Streaming means listening to music or watching Video in real time, instead of downloading a file to your computer and watching it later. 

Readable - Stream which is used to read operation. 

Writable - Stream which is used for write operations. 

Duplex - Stream whcih can be used to read and write operations. 

Transform - A type duplex stream where the output is computed based on input. 

Each type of Stream is an EventsEmitter instance and throws several events at different instance of times. For example, some of the commonly used events are:

data - This events is fired when there is data is avaiable to read. 
end - This events is fired when there is no more data to read. 
error - This events is fired when there is any error receiving or writing data. 
finish - This event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system. 


stream.pipe() this method used to take a readable strea and connect it to a writable stream.
